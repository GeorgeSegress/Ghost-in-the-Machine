# Ghost in the Machine
Ghost in the Machine is an upcoming horror game passion project I have been developing under the Chiodo Studios label. The game sees you playing as a robot left behind on Earth, tasked with bringing back civilization through clearing the land of rogue AI. With a unique text-based rendering, horror from uncertain surroundings comes naturally as you play through the intense experience. 

# Code Features:
The ASCII-based rendering system was developed by me and pushes Unity's render textures to their limits, using them as data files to be broken down into pixelated averages, then translated into text that fills the screen using a text gradient.the unique renderer allows for players to feel like the robot themselves. 
Audio logs are also given using Software Automated Mouth (SAM) to create an uneasy old technological feeling. Audio logs can be reread through at any time. 
Enemy AI is also fairly complex, using a state based system and pathing algorithm to patrol their given spot, follow the player if spotted, and continue on their path if the player stands still.

A gameplay demonstration of the early vertical slice can be seen here:
